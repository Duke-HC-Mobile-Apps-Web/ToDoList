# ToDoList

A reminder (also on Piazza and Sakai), we'd like you to:

* Show items in the TableView as they get added by the user

* Add a 2nd TextField below the first one which allows the user to enter additional information about the task
  * Show this additional info in the TableView (cell.detailTextLabel)


This should be submitted as a pull request before 2/10.  The pull request will update with the result of the auto-testing done by Travis-CI at which point you can push additional commits to fix any errors (if necessary).
